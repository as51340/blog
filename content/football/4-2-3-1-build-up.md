## Introduction

I am usually playing against 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 formations where teams press with 2 or at most 3 players. When pressing with 3 this is usually not on very 
high level so same ideas are used. 

## Situation I: Opposite striker presses

When only 1 opposite striker is pressing, the situation can be usually solved with center-backs and goalkeeper only in the 1st zone. 
The ball is played from the GK to one CB who can try to push into the midfield. If this isn't possible, we go back to the GK and circle
around to the next CB. As CB is trying to move the ball forward, GK should come few meters out so that ball circulation is faster.

*Diagram I: Since CBs and GK effectively play 3vs.1, midfielders should push higher-up the pitch and play in half-spaces. Full-backs also push in order
to pin opposite wingers.*

Usually, 1-2 circulations from one CB to another CB is enough since one striker alone cannot cover that much space.

*Diagram II: With the right timing and high-quality passes, the ball can be transferred to CB(4) who can then penetrate the midfield. Notice the positioning of #4 who didn't go
too much to the side in order to be able to take as much space as possible with the 1st touch.*

It is important to notice that in this case, playing the ball to the side usually doesn't lead to any progress in space won since opposition's 
wingers play 1vs.1 on our full-backs. That's why it is important that center-backs are brave when moving the ball forward to they could create
2vs.1 with the full-back on the wing.

*When CB(#4) has the space, he exploits it. That will trigger the winger(#7) who will find himself in a difficult situation where he needs to defend 2vs.1 on the side.
When the 1st line of pressure is won, options in depth have a lot of sense. E.g opposite winger(#7) who makes diagonal run behind the full-back(#3).*

## Instructions

As we saw, there are several options but what is important is how to give players simple, intuitive instructions that they can use 
when various situations occur.
- midifielders don't drop if not necessary
- no need for 2 midfielders dropping if only one is enough
- midfielders, perform the rotation
- center-backs be brave, exploit the space
- full-backs seek for space
- full-backs don't limit your space to the side, come inside 
- strikers, you have to move, search for space and do runs into the depth, even if you won't get the ball
