Two categories of products used in the industry can be identified. First category of products mainly deal with a support for **event tagging and drawing visualizations**. One of the best examples of a first category is [Once](https://once.de/), the product which has the possibility to tag actions based on the information about **action's end result**.  
[StatsPerform](https://www.statsperform.com/) is a main representative of the second category of products supporting **ball and player tracking**. Except for an incredible amount of information it can provide analysts with, such platform allows **analysis of opponent team without any GPS devices required**. They distinguish themself from the rest of the competition by an extensive tactical analysis. Edge analysis provides the user with precise tactical insights based on the tracking data. **Team shape analysis** detects game moments in which **opponent team makes mistakes**, **space can be exploited** and quantifies all that with interpretable numbers for an end user. Most of the features are based on complex **AI models**. **The PossessionValue model** measures player's impact on the probability of his team scoring in the next 10 seconds of the match. Recently, **quantifying pressure players impose in a specific game moment and detailed set-piece analysis** are some of the most important parts of the game on which much focus has been put.  
StatsPerform uses **Opta** in the background to generate **vast amount of match-related data**. This data is collected in the **blended process of combining AI computer vision models with human annotators** who thorougly correct system's inefficiencies.
[Spiideo](https://www.spiideo.com/) uses AI on a level above, to obtain **high-quality panomaric footages** without human intervention required. There are many other video analysis software solutions like [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/), [Dartfish](https://www.dartfish.com/), [Longomatch](https://longomatch.com/en/), [Nacsport](https://www.nacsport.com/index.php?lc=en-us) etc., no offend to others not mentioned. Except for StatsPerform, more-less all systems are mainly visualization tools wih only a basic capabilities of generating data. However, they really excel in creating powerful visualization, tagging capabilities and its immense number of dashboards that can be created.

This blog post gives a basic introduction to industry-level products useful for the football analysis. In the next blog post, I will try to explain in more details how object detection is useful for such tasks. Until the next time ðŸ«¡.
