how do I implement when coaching. In this blog-post find out about several tactical ideas in the build-up of 4-2-3-1 formation."

## Introduction

In the [last blog post](/blog/football/4-2-3-1-build-up-b) we explored options for breaking high-press with 2 strikers. We noticed that it is important that our midfielders don't drop back if not necessary and that with fast enough circulation, space can be found on sides or that one midfielder has to stay alone. Today we will explore attacking build-up options when opposition presses very high with 3 or more attacking players, the situation that is most often occurring against best teams in the league.


## Situation III: 3 opposition attackers press

At the beginning, our players our positioned as shown in the diagram below:

![4-2-3-1 beginning ](/blog/images/4_2_3_1_initial_setup.png "4-2-3-1")
*Diagram I: GK puts the ball at the center of 5m box. CBs stay at the edge of the 16m box. Full-backs push high up the pitch so that opposition's wingers have to defend more space between CB and FB. Midfielders push high up the pitch.*


### Option I: Midfield rotation

*Diagram II: In the 1st rotation, the midfielder closer to the side where the GK played the ball drops low and offers option in the middle. Full-back drops a little lower, while our #10 moves to the side to close the diamond created. Even if #10 doesn't stay alone, this simple rotation will often cause problems for the opposition and there is high-probability that one of our midfielders will have enough time to receive, turn and move the ball out from the pressure.*


## Final - Build-up algorithm

1. GK puts the ball at the center of 5m box
2. CBs stay at the edge of the box
3. Midfielders don't stay low immediately, full-backs push higher-up the pitch. GK wait until we're all prepared.
4. Play the ball to the CB. If possible, push higher-up the pitch alone in order to create numerical advantage. If not possible, circulate back to the GK and change sides. If that doesn't pass, one DM drop low, other 2 midfielders do the rotation from Option I, full-backs drop lower.
5. If nothing works, long ball to the striker who must be able to protect it, doesn't matter if he is able to turn or not, it is important that he protects so we could move higher from the pressure.
