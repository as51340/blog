## Dribbling

The easiest and often the most useful tool we can use in solving football situations is dribbling. If attacking player dribbles the defender, he immediately created numerical advantage.

*Diagram I: Dribbling immediately creates numerical advantage.*

## One-two

In the 2nd option player passes to his teammate and continues with his run in space trying to make a space with his dynamic movements. Can be very effective in the midfield where there isn't a lot of space.

*Diagram II: One-two with fast movement creates a space in which the player can receive the ball.*

## Cross run

#2 plays a pass to #1 in the feet, #1 plays a layoff to a #2 who already came and is prepared to receive the ball. #1 then makes a diagonal side-opening to a space in which he can receive the ball from #2.
